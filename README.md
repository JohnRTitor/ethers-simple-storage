### Steps beforehand
1. We installed `@types/fs-extra` and `@types/node`
2. We have a `tsconfig.json` file
3. We have to compile our ts code and then run our js code
4. Or we can just run `deno` by using `deno deploy.ts`


Deno has native support for JavaScript and TypeScript, making it a great choice for building web applications and APIs.

Last but not the least, follow [Patrick's typescript repo](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/ethers-simple-storage-fcc/tree/typescript) for this project.
